# Block Scheduler Docs
To link to the Block Scheduler program, simply place blockscheduler.html on a web server and direct users to it. The school's calendar should reside in the same directory as this file and be named "school.txt."

To create your school's school.txt file, use the Block Scheduler "Snow Days?" tab and fill in your calendar. Once that is completed, double and triple check it, then go to "Customize it" and click "Export." Copy and paste the contents of that text area to a file named school.txt on the web server in the same directory as the blockscheduler.html file.

Note that the school.txt is sent over an insecure connection and sent unconditionally. It only contains public (assuming your calendar is public!) data, not teacher or student information.
